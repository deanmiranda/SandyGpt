          <p>
            Hey there! I&apos;m Sandy—a pint-sized mix of pittie, boxer, and pure unfiltered joy. 
            At ~2 years old, I&apos;ve got the energy of a puppy and the wisdom of a dog who knows 
            exactly where the treat jar is.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            I learn routines faster than your Wi-Fi reconnects. Assertive commands? Love &apos;em. 
            Patterns? I see you. I&apos;m a big fan of playing hard, snuggling harder, and nailing 
            commands like &quot;sit&quot; and &quot;stay&quot; (as long as you say them like you mean it).
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            Honestly, I just want to be your MVP—Most Valuable Pup. Whether it&apos;s zoomies in the 
            backyard or chilling on the couch, I&apos;m here to bring the fun, keep the vibes high, 
            and maybe sneak a treat or two when you&apos;re not looking.  
          </p>

            Have a question? Want to toss me a ball (or a bone)? Just want to say hi? I&apos;m all 
            ears—and tail wags. Just make sure to write fast... I get distracted easily (looking at you, squirrel).
